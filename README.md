# x7clib
my personal library for all the interesting things in C

Finally following [Andreas Kling](https://awesomekling.github.io/)'s [wonderful advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpzPT_9qzPI&t=342s)
and making my own personal c library.  
It feels like a perfect place to put all the interesting pieces of code that I encounter or things that I try to
implement, instead of writing them once and forgetting about them.

##### my Adventure:
It's a long and unnecessary reading..  
But if you're curious, you can find it here: 313bfd47bc46eddd08c4fc7a4e82f104de3daec8 (git checkout it in this repo)  
It answers one of those questions like: "How do I get started doing [insert something technical here]".
